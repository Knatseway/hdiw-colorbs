        Light up your face with gladness
        Hide every trace of sadness
        Although a tear may be ever so near
        That's the time you must keep on trying
        Smile, what's the use of crying?
        You'll find that life is still worthwhile
        If you just smile
        That's the time you must keep on trying
        Smile, what's the use of crying?
        You'll find that life is still worthwhile
        If you just smile</p>
